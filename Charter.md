# Ambassador's charter
 
## Mission
Software Heritage is building the universal software source code archive, that  enables a wealth of applications, in the realms of academia, cultural heritage, industry and public administration. Ambassadors are enthusiastic individuals  volunteering to help grow the Software Heritage community.
 
## Communication
The SWH ambassador program coordinator will send all announcements concerning ambassadors through the swh-ambassadors mailing list.
A Slack channel is available for fast chats. If anything relevant to others comes up in Slack it should be relayed to all ambassadors through the mailing list.
 
Feel free to send messages to the mailing list or to the slack channel on
subjects related to SWH and software preservation in general.
 
## Questions from your community
If you have a question or if you get a question from your community to which you don't have the answer, please follow the following protocol:
1. check the FAQ section in the swh-ambassadors repository
2. if there is no answer in the FAQ,
   2.a. (recommended) open an issue in the repository with the question to see if this question should be add into the FAQ or if it is answered in an obscure location that should be reviewed and changed
   2.b. send an email/chat message to the ambassadors mailing list/ channel
3. Give the accurate answer or propose to get back with the answer at a later time
 
It is important to provide accurate information and it is normal that no one has all the information on hand (except Roberto ;-).
Don't worry if you don't give an answer, it is always better to provide constant trustworthy answers.
 
## Training
We can schedule a training workshop for interested ambassadors to review the SWH mission and the archive's features.
