# How to contribute

This is the swh-ambassadors repository intended for the Software Heritage 
ambassadors and the Software Heritage community to contribute to the 
documentation of Software Heritage.

You can provide materials directly in the `materials` directory with a PR.
For the FAQ, you can edit with a PR by adding questions or updating answers.
It is also possible to open tickets in this repository with a new FAQ question
in the title.

## PR vs Issue

If you are not comfortable doing a PR, don't hesitate writing an issue to 
specifically identify an unanswered question or suggest adaptation for existing 
FAQ items.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the main branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on main, run `git checkout -b
    fix/main/my_contribution main`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `main` branch.
* Make commits of logical and atomic units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
