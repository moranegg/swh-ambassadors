### Ideas of actions
#### Connect with communities, expand the archive
- Make connection with [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/).
    >The mission of NumFOCUS is to promote open practices in research, data, and scientific computing by serving as a fiscal sponsor for open source projects and organizing community-driven educational programs.
    >-- https://numfocus.org/community/mission
- How much projects mentioned in the Nature article “Ten computer codes that transformed Science” (2021, https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00075-2) are archived in SWH? Can we increase this number?
- Make link between press articles on highlighted open-source software and SWH. 
    - The 20th birthday of VLC.
